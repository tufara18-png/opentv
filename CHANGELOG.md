# Changelog

## 0.12.0

**TufaraTV** — this fork's own identity: rebranded from OpenTV (new package, icon, colours), and a
TMDB-first rebuild of Movies and Shows so the catalogue you browse no longer depends on any one
provider's own categories.

### Movies & Shows

- **TMDB drives the catalogue, providers only supply playback.** Movies and Shows now show TMDB's
  own Trending/Popular/New/Top-rated rows, genre rails (Action, Comédie, Horreur, …), and full
  detail pages — all of it visible whether or not a synced playlist happens to carry a given title.
  Opening a title resolves an already-synced playable source locally, with no network call to a
  provider at click time.
- **Movies only offer sources in French, Italian, or a multi-language copy.** A source in another
  language is never offered as a choice; a title only available in one is shown as unavailable
  rather than handed over anyway.
- **Everything TMDB returns comes back in your language** — titles, synopses, cast and genre names,
  not just the browse labels.

### Live TV

- **Channels group by country, not by provider category**, in a real-world lineup order (TNT/general
  first, then sport, then cinema) — the same shelf whichever provider supplied a given channel.
- **Canada orders Québec channels first** — general and specialty alike (Radio-Canada, TVA, RDS,
  AddikTV, ARTV, Canal D, Canal Vie, Yoopa, …) — then English-Canada sport, then the rest of
  English-Canada, recognised by channel name so it holds regardless of how a given provider tags
  its categories.
- **A channel plays immediately on click**, full-screen, instead of opening a menu first; long-press
  still reaches Watch/Record/Schedule.
- **An on-screen guide overlay** while watching live — current programme, progress, and what's on
  next — without leaving full-screen.
- Back from a movie, series, or live channel detail page returns to that same tab, not to Live TV.

### Channel management

- **Hide a whole country/category at once** from the channel manager, not just one channel at a
  time — and it stays hidden even once a later sync adds a new channel to that category.
- The live guide's sidebar drops a group entirely once every one of its channels is hidden, instead
  of leaving an entry that opens onto an empty guide.
- Removed the "All channels" entry — the guide now opens straight on the first real category.

### Also in this release

- Netflix-style black-and-red theme throughout.
- Full Stalker Portal support (MAG-box device identity, portal URL + MAC login) alongside Xtream
  and M3U, unchanged from upstream OpenTV.

## 0.11.8

- **Edit a saved provider.** Settings → Providers now has an **Edit** button on each provider, so you
  can fix a server address, password, MAC or name in place instead of removing and re-adding it —
  your favourites, hidden channels and per-provider settings are kept.
- **Stalker portals: fewer dropped sessions.** A portal that occasionally rejected a call
  mid-session (channels loading only "sometimes") now gets one automatic re-handshake and retry, so
  an intermittent refusal becomes a silent re-auth rather than an empty channel list or a channel
  that won't tune.
- **Player controls stay clear of the system bar off-TV.** On phones and tablets the bottom control
  bar (subtitles, audio, quality, aspect ratio) could be drawn under the navigation bar and cut off;
  it's now inset above it. No change on Android TV.

## 0.11.7

- **Stalker portals: closer to a real box.** Building on v0.11.6, OpenTV now sends the rest of the
  identity a real MAG set-top box presents at login — the auth token in the session cookie (not just
  the header), a hardware-version hash, a timestamp and the box's API signature — and it probes a
  couple more portal paths. Some Ministra/Stalker panels only return the channel list when they see
  all of this, so lines that connected but showed no channels have a better chance of loading. If a
  portal still comes up empty, please open an issue and say which panel software it runs.

## 0.11.6

- **Stalker portals: full set-top-box identity.** OpenTV now authenticates to Stalker/Ministra
  portals the way a real MAG box does — sending the device serial, `device_id`, a signature and a
  metrics blob derived from your MAC, instead of the MAC on its own. Many portals won't hand over
  the channel list or stream links to a box that only presents a MAC, which is why some lines that
  worked in other apps came up empty in OpenTV. This lets those portals authorise OpenTV. If a
  portal still fails, please open an issue and say which one — it helps a lot.

## 0.11.5

- **Add a provider from your phone or laptop.** The "Manage on phone or laptop" web page now has an
  **Add a provider** section — pick Xtream, M3U or Stalker portal, fill it in with a real keyboard,
  then Test and Add. Channels load straight onto the TV, so you never have to type a server address
  or a MAC on the remote again.
- **Fixed the "camera won't scan it?" web address.** The manage screen was printing that link without
  its access token, so typing it into a browser hit a dead "Not found". It now shows the full working
  URL, and the token is short enough to type.


## 0.11.4

The big DVR release. Recordings behave like Sky Q, you can record straight to a NAS, watch a
recording while it's still taping, and the whole interface now speaks 30 languages.

### Recording & DVR

- **Watch a recording while it's still recording.** Start playing something the moment it begins
  taping — OpenTV reads the growing file straight off disk, so it costs **zero extra connections**
  to your provider. On a single-stream account that's the difference between "wait until it's
  finished" and "watch now". Fast-forward and rewind work within whatever's been taped so far.
- **Record straight to a NAS.** Point recordings at a network share over SMB (Settings →
  Recordings → NAS, or set it up from the phone/laptop web manager) so a cheap box isn't boxed in
  by its own storage — and every OpenTV in the house can reach the same recordings.
- **Single-connection auto-switch.** On a one-stream provider, if a recording is due to start on
  another channel, OpenTV moves the screen onto that recording as it begins — with a **30-second
  warning** first and a *Keep watching* button if you'd rather not. No more "why did my live stream
  just cut out?" (Recordings → Recording behaviour → *Auto-switch when recording starts*.)
- **Clash handling with multi-provider fallback.** Book two overlapping recordings and, if more
  than one of your providers carries that channel, OpenTV records each from a **different provider**
  so neither is cut. On a single provider it flags the clash instead.
- **Recording padding.** Start each recording a minute early and run a few minutes past the listed
  end, so a late kick-off or an overrun isn't clipped. Adjustable per side.
- **Series links show the next episode.** A series link now tells you exactly when it next records.
- **Storage readout.** See how much space recordings use and how much is left.

### Live TV

- **Pause & rewind live TV** *(experimental, opt-in).* Holds the last couple of minutes so you can
  pause and jump back. Off by default — it uses more memory.

### Languages

- **30 languages.** The whole interface is translated into Spanish, French, German, Italian,
  Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi,
  Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Czech, Greek, Romanian, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Indonesian,
  Thai, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Slovak, Croatian and Persian. Settings → Language (each listed in
  its own name), or leave it on *System* to follow your device.

### Fixes & polish

- Smoother watch-while-recording, especially from a NAS: playback now keeps a buffer behind the
  live edge so a network share doesn't stutter at the write head.
- Back never lands you on a stray live channel or drops you out by accident — coming back from a
  recording returns to your recordings, and Back on the home screen asks before it exits.
- Password fields are masked, with a show/hide toggle.
- Recording stability: NAS write timeouts and reconnect handling, so a quiet network doesn't
  silently freeze a capture.

### Notes

- Everything stays on your device — provider logins never leave the box.
- Free and open source (GPL-3.0): https://github.com/opentvproject/opentv


## 0.10.0

- **Movies & Shows, redesigned.** A Plex-style layout with big artwork, cast & director, "more with
  this cast" rows, and cleaned-up titles (no more "NF -" / "(KR)" junk). Optional: add your own free
  TMDB key in Settings → Metadata and OpenTV fills in any posters, backdrops, cast or synopses your
  provider left blank — the key stays on your device.
- **No more stuck "Loading movies & shows".** The movies/series catalogue is cached, so it loads
  instantly on later launches instead of re-downloading every time — and the live preview no longer
  stutters while it loads.
- **Record to a USB / external drive.** Settings → Recordings → USB, pick a folder on a plugged-in
  drive, and recordings write straight there (no storage permission needed) and play back in-app.
- **Recordings screen overhaul.** Scheduled recordings show *when* they'll record and sit in their
  own "Scheduled" section; failed ones have a **Retry**; each is tagged to a profile; and bookings
  re-arm on every launch so a force-stop or app update can't quietly drop them.

## 0.9.0

- **Manage your channels from a phone or laptop.** A new "Manage on phone or laptop" screen in
  Settings shows a QR code and a link — open it on any device on your wifi and you get a proper web
  page to browse, **rename**, hide, favourite and **reorder** channels with a real keyboard and
  mouse. Changes apply to the TV instantly. Local-only: the TV is the server, nothing touches a
  cloud.
- **Recording keeps going when you leave the app or the box sleeps.** OpenTV can now ask Android to
  exempt it from battery optimisation (Settings → Recording → "Recording in the background"), which
  is what keeps recordings running in standby and when you switch away — swiping OpenTV out of
  recents no longer stops a recording either.
- **Rename channels.** Give a channel your own name; it sticks and survives a guide refresh (from
  the web manager for now).
- **Tidier update notes.** The "update available" prompt shows a clean summary of what's new instead
  of build metadata.

## 0.8.0

- **No more endless "Loading channels".** If a provider fails to load or comes back empty (a wrong
  login, a dead server), the guide now shows a clear error with **Retry** and **Provider setup**
  buttons instead of spinning forever.
- **Set up on a phone without the QR dance.** Installing on a phone now shows the login form
  directly so you can type your details in; the QR code is only offered on a TV, where typing is the
  painful part.
- **Paste into the setup fields.** The URL, username and password fields — and the on-screen
  keyboard — now have a **Paste** button, so a copied Xtream line drops straight in.
- **MPEG-TS or HLS, your choice.** Each Xtream provider now has a **Stream format** toggle. If your
  panel only serves `.ts` and channels wouldn't play, switch to MPEG-TS and they will. Defaults to
  HLS, so nothing changes unless you need it.
- **Parental controls scrolls.** The hidden-categories list is reachable to the bottom now, however
  many categories your provider has.
- **A real Channel Manager.** Settings → Channels is now a browsable, two-pane manager: pick a
  category on the left, see its channels on the right, hide or favourite each one — including
  hidden channels so you can bring them back. With more than one provider, a **source filter** keeps
  them separate instead of merged into one list.

## 0.3.0

- **Profiles.** Add local profiles (just a name — no accounts) from the person icon in the top
  menu, and switch between them. Each profile keeps its own resume points and watched state, so
  your half-watched film doesn't show as watched on someone else's profile. Existing resume points
  become the default "Me" profile's — nothing is lost.
- **Continue Watching.** Movies and Shows now open with a "Continue watching" shelf for the active
  profile — pick up your last film or episode where you left off, with a progress bar on each.
- **Local sync (no servers).** Settings → Sync copies your continue-watching between two OpenTV
  devices over your own wifi: one device shares behind a six-digit code, the other receives. It's
  local-only — nothing leaves the house — the household answer to the cloud sync that died with
  Viewella.

- **Proper player controls.** A single control bar slides up from the bottom with play/pause,
  rewind/forward (where the stream allows it), and pickers for **subtitles, audio track, quality
  and aspect ratio**. It hides after a few seconds and any remote button brings it back —
  nothing is ever left painted permanently over the picture.
- **Captions that actually show.** Subtitles are now chosen from the real tracks in the stream
  (and can be turned off), instead of a blind on/off that often left the renderer enabled but
  nothing on screen. Audio-track switching works the same way for multi-language streams.
- **Page through the guide.** Earlier / Now / Later buttons above the guide move the timeline
  forward and back, so you can see what's on later this evening with a remote.
- **Live preview in the guide.** The highlighted channel now plays, muted, inside the preview
  pane. It uses a single player that stops the instant you go full-screen or leave the guide —
  no second decoder — and it can be turned off in Display & playback for older boxes.
- **Channel manager.** Settings → Channels: search for a channel and hide it from the guide (or
  favourite it). Hidden channels drop out of Live TV and search but stay here, greyed, so you can
  bring them back. Hiding covers every quality variant of a channel at once.
- **Parental controls.** Set a 4-digit PIN and mark categories as hidden — they drop out of the
  guide, All channels and search until you unlock them (and with a PIN set, the parental screen
  itself is locked). In Settings → Parental controls.
- **Unified search with an on-screen keyboard.** Search now has its own screen with a d-pad
  keyboard (no more "type on your phone") and covers **channels, movies and shows** together, with
  live results as you type. Reachable from the top menu.
- **Loading indicators for Movies and Shows.** Both now show a spinner while the catalogue is
  syncing instead of a premature "nothing here".
- **Settings and Search in the top menu.** Both now live top-right, next to Live TV / Movies /
  Shows, instead of being buried behind the guide's icons.
- **A single Settings screen.** One Settings hub — Providers (add / remove / re-test sources), TV
  guide, Display & playback, Parental controls, and About (version, a manual update check,
  licence and links).
- **Dark / light / follow-system.** A new appearance setting. TV still defaults to dark; pick
  Dark or Light to force it on any device.
- **Quality picker only when there's a choice.** No more "Quality: Standard" on single-quality
  channels; the picker appears only when a channel actually has multiple qualities.
- New **Display & playback** settings screen (the sliders icon in the guide).

## 0.2.0

- **Guide detail pane** — highlighting a channel now shows its logo, what's on now with
  start/end times and a live progress bar, a synopsis when the guide carries one, and what's
  on next. Press to watch full-screen.
- **Live progress fill** on the current programme in the guide grid, and a focus highlight on
  the highlighted channel.
- **Fix: never asks for your provider again.** A cold launch could briefly decide "first run"
  before your saved sources had loaded and drop you on the setup screen — it now waits for the
  sources to load before deciding what to show.
- **Fix: no second video decoder on the guide**, which was locking up low-end boxes (a
  Chromecast could freeze). The detail pane is logo + guide info; the one decoder lives
  full-screen.
