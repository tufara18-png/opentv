     * The app-wide Coil loader, tuned for a poster-and-logo heavy UI on a low-end TV box. The
     * default loader keeps a small memory cache and no disk cache, so scrolling back through a
     * shelf — or reopening Movies — re-downloads and re-decodes every image. Here:
     *  - a generous memory cache and a 256 MB disk cache mean art you've already seen paints from
     *    cache, instantly, instead of hitting the network;
     *  - no crossfade — an immediate swap reads as snappier on a d-pad grid than a fade, and skips
     *    a frame of blending per image;
     *  - RGB_565 for opaque art (posters/backdrops) halves the memory per bitmap, so more fits in
     *    cache; Coil keeps ARGB_8888 for anything with transparency, so channel logos are untouched.
