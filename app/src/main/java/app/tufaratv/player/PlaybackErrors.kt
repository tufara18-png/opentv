/**
 * Turns a [PlaybackException] into something a person can act on.
 *
 * "ERROR_CODE_IO_BAD_HTTP_STATUS" tells a user nothing. Worse, the habit of showing a raw
 * error code on screen is what led one player to *remove* its 403 display entirely as a
 * "fix" — hiding the symptom while the stream still failed. The right answer is to say what
 * probably went wrong and what to try.
