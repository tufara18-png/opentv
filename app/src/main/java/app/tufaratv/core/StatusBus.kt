/**
 * A single line of "what the app is doing right now" — loading channels, building the guide,
 * loading movies — with an optional 0..1 progress fraction so slow jobs can show a real bar rather
 * than a spinner that gives nothing away. Shown as a slim status bar, so a big provider's slow
 * moments read as visible work instead of a frozen screen. Deliberately app-wide and dead simple:
 * any background job announces itself, the shell shows whatever's current, and it clears when done.
