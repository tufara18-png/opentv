/**
 * A "stop watching after a while" timer — the thing you set when you're dozing off in front of a
 * film. Deliberately in-memory and app-wide: a sleep timer that survived an app restart would be a
 * surprise, and it needs to be visible from both the settings screen (where you arm it) and the
 * players (which honour it), so a plain singleton beats threading it through the database.
 *
 * The players observe [deadline] and, once the clock passes it, leave playback. Setting a new
 * duration re-arms it; [clear] cancels.
