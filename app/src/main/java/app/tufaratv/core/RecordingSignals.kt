/**
 * The link between a scheduled recording firing and the live UI reacting to it.
 *
 * On a single-connection provider account you cannot watch one channel and record another at the
 * same time — the provider cuts one of the two streams. OpenTV's answer, when auto-switch is on, is
 * to move the live view onto the recording itself: 30 seconds before a booking starts the UI warns
 * the viewer ([imminent]), and when the capture begins the UI switches to *watching the recording
 * file* ([watch]) rather than opening a second live stream. That's one connection, no conflict, and
 * the viewer ends up on exactly what's being recorded.
 *
 * All of this lives in one process (the capture service and the UI share it), so plain flows and a
 * small set are all it takes. Values are one-shot: set from a broadcast receiver or the service,
 * consumed by the nav graph, and cleared so a stale one never re-fires.
