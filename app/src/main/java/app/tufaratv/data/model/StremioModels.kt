 * A user-added Stremio add-on: a small web service (identified by its manifest URL) that, given a
 * title, returns playable stream links. OpenTV ships with none — the user pastes the manifest URL
 * of an add-on they have configured themselves (including any debrid key, which is baked into that
 * personalised URL on the add-on's own site, never entered into OpenTV). Stored on-device only,
 * exactly like a provider credential.
 *
 * This is the same open protocol Stremio and Kodi speak; OpenTV is only a neutral client for it and
 * hosts, indexes and bundles no content of its own.
