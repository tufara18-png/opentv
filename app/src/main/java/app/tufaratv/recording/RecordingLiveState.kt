/**
 * A tiny in-process registry of which recordings are capturing *right now*, and where their bytes
 * are landing. It exists so the player can watch a recording while it is still being written: the
 * [app.tufaratv.player.GrowingRecordingDataSource] reads the growing file and, when it reaches the
 * current end, asks here whether the capture is still live — if it is, it waits for more bytes
 * rather than declaring the file finished.
 *
 * Recording and playback are in the same process, so a plain concurrent map is all this needs;
 * [RecordingService] marks a capture active when it starts and inactive in its `finally`.
