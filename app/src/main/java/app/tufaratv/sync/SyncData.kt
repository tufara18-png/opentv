/**
 * The state two OpenTV devices exchange when they sync.
 *
 * Nothing here is keyed by a local database id — those differ from one install to the next. An
 * item is identified by something stable for the same provider: a channel/movie by its **stream
 * URL**, a series by its **provider series id**, a profile by its **name**, a category by its
 * **group key**, a NAS recording by its **smb:// locator**. So a bundle from one device makes
 * sense on another.
 *
 * Two merge policies travel together, matching how people actually use this:
 *  - **Watch positions** are two-way, newest-wins per item (you watch on any device, resume on
 *    all), using [SyncPosition.updatedAtMillis].
 *  - **Curation and recordings** are additive: favourites, hidden channels, hidden categories and
 *    NAS recordings from a peer are merged in without ever removing anything local. You tidy up on
 *    one device and the others adopt it, but a favourite set only on one box is never lost.
 *
 * Every field defaults to empty and the reader ignores unknown keys, so a positions-only device
 * and a full device interoperate without a flag day.
